<p>So you're going to a GATK workshop, and you've been selected to participate in a hands-on session? Fantastic! We're looking forward to walking you through some exercises that will help you master the tools. However -- in order to make the best of the time we have together, we'd like to ask you to come prepared. Specifically, <em>if the workshop hosts are not providing machines and you have been asked to bring your own laptop</em>, please complete the following steps:</p>
<h4>- Download and install all necessary software as described in <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=7098">this tutorial</a>.</h4>
<p>Note that if you are a Mac user, you may need to install Apple's XCode Tools, which are free but fairly large, so plan ahead because it can take a loooong time to download them if your connection is anything less than super-fast.</p>
<h4>- Download the tutorial bundle from the link provided by the workshop organizers.</h4>
<p>This will typically be provided by email two to three weeks before the date of the workshop. </p>
<p>At the start of the session, we'll give you handouts with a walkthrough of the session so you can follow along and take notes (highly recommended!). </p>
<p>With that, you should be all set. See you soon!</p>
